<!-- Crypto Scout - Project Overview

Crypto Scout is a due diligence tool designed for Crypto Venture Capital (VC) firms and other investors to evaluate early-stage crypto startups. It automates parts of the analysis process by aggregating data from sources like GitHub and CoinGecko, providing an objective scoring system to rank projects based on key metrics like developer activity and market performance.

Key Features:

Automated Data Aggregation: Pulls in data from APIs such as GitHub for developer activity and CoinGecko for market performance.

Objective Scoring: Uses a customizable algorithm to score projects based on criteria like GitHub activity, market trends, and tokenomics.

Risk Identification: Flags potential risks, such as low development activity or suspicious tokenomics.

Dashboard & Visualization: Offers a comparative view of multiple projects along with visualizations to aid decision-making.

User-Friendly Interface: Built using Streamlit for an accessible, web-based interaction.

Target Users:

Crypto VCs and Angel Investors: To streamline and standardize the due diligence process.
Hedge Funds & Family Offices: For evaluating long-term investment potential.
Incubators/Accelerators: For assessing the quality of crypto startups before offering mentorship or funding.

Development Plan:
The project is developed over two weeks, with initial focus on API integration, data handling, and scoring. This is followed by the creation of a user interface using Streamlit and basic user authentication, culminating in testing and final refinements. -->
